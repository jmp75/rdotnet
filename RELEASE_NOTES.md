## 1.8.2

* Fix for [Data frame with character columns: unexpected results with R 3.5+](https://github.com/jmp75/rdotnet/issues/97). Thanks to Luke Rasmussen for this.
* R.NET can on all recent R versions from 3.4 onwards. While not extensively tested, any of the R 3.X releases should be supported. Note that on Linux only 3.5.y is supported due to a difficulty in detecting R versions on that OS.
* R.NET assemblies now target netstandard2.0 and support .NET core (2.0) and .NET framework (4.6.1+ but preferably 4.7.2 see [.NET implementation support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard#net-implementation-support) )
* Key contributions by Luke Rasmussen, David Pendray and others are gratefully acknowledged to make this release possible
